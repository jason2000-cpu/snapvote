# Poll Editing Feature

## Overview

The poll editing feature allows users to modify their own polls after creation. This document explains how the feature works and the security measures in place.

## User Flow

1. A user navigates to a poll they created
2. If they are the creator, an "Edit Poll" button appears next to the "Back to Polls" button
3. Clicking this button takes them to the edit page where they can modify:
   - Poll title
   - Poll description
   - Poll options (add, remove, or modify)
4. After submitting changes, they are redirected back to the poll page

## Security Measures

Multiple layers of security ensure that only poll creators can edit their polls:

1. **UI Level**: The edit button is only visible to the poll creator
2. **Client Level**: The edit page checks if the current user is the poll creator
3. **Server Level**: The `updatePoll` server action verifies the user's identity before allowing edits

## Technical Implementation

### Files

- `app/polls/[id]/page.tsx` - Displays the poll and conditionally shows the edit button
- `app/polls/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit form for modifying poll details
- `app/polls/actions.ts` - Contains the `updatePoll` server action with authorization checks

### Authorization Flow

1. The edit page fetches the poll data including the `user_id` field
2. It compares this with the current user's ID from the auth context
3. If they don't match, an "Unauthorized" message is displayed
4. The server action performs an additional check before applying changes

## Database Updates

When a poll is edited, the following operations may occur:

1. Update the poll title and description
2. Update existing options (text changes)
3. Delete removed options
4. Add new options

All changes are tracked with an `updated_at` timestamp.
